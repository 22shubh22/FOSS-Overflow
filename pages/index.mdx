<h2>About</h2>

<p>
	FOSS Overflow is a month-long festival celebrating open source and innovation
	organized by Google Developer Student Clubs and OpenLake at IIT Bhilai.
	Intensely sprawling over 4 weeks, it aims to give hands-on experience of open
	source development to students with little to medium level of experience on
	the subject. Students are paired up with mentors to work on open sourced
	projects and amplify their skills and profile in the process while
	simultaneously bagging cash awards and prizes. The endeavour is designed to
	ameliorate the participants outlook and preparedness for global programs like
	GSoC, LFX and Outreachy among others.
