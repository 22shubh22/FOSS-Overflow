## Why Should I Apply?

Well now you’ve known that [FOSS Overflow](https://owoc.vercel.app) seems like something productive to do this December. But shouldn’t I just go on a trip or sleep my way through the vacations? Well here are some of the reasons why you should apply for it.

### Work Experience

OWoC is a place where you not only get to use your current skill set on existing projects, but you are definitely going to hone them. The feeling of working in collaboration is one important skill set which probably is going to be new to you. On the other hand, the mentors of the projects themselves have recently been through what you would be going through while creating your first code patch. So, you get to be patient while working on the small fixes and managing the git workflow.

### Acquiring New Skill Sets

While you’ll be adding your piece of code to the existing piece of software, you will get to learn the structure of the software and more about the process of creating it from scratch.

That, in the future will help you in creating your own software.
