<h2>About</h2>

FOSSIL is a month-long festival celebrating open source and innovation organized by Google Developer Student Clubs and OpenLake at IIT Bhilai. Intensely sprawling over 4 weeks, it aims to give hands-on experience of open source development to students with little to medium level of experience on the subject. Students are paired up with mentors to work on open sourced projects and amplify their skills and profile in the process while simultaneously bagging cash awards and prizes. The endeavour is designed to ameliorate the participants outlook and preparedness for global programs like GSoC, LFX and Outreachy among others.

<h2>How it works?</h2>

Participants can apply for the program either as a student or as a mentor. Mentors are selected through a selection process. The selected mentors propose projects, the best of which are chosen to be included in the program. Students work on these projects in their winter vacations. The mentors review the pull requests and the overall work on their project by various contributors throughout the coding period of the program. At the end of the coding period, the students are compared on the basis of most contributions.
